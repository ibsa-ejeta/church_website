    "projectDescription": "Oromo Evangelical Church of Toronto (OECT) formerly known as 'The Oromo Christian Church of Toronto' was initiated in the early 1990s as a fellowship by Oromo immigrants to Canada residing in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and surrounding cities who committed themselves to worship God in their mother-tongue (Afaan Oromoo) to bring a holistic impact in the lives of their communities living in Oromia and abroad. A few years later, the fellowship grew, and this group of Christians came together and agreed to adopt a constitution and transform the fellowship into a more formal establishment."

    "projectDescription": "OECT believes that confession is part of the sanctification process and aids Christians in dealing with sin and healing from it (1 John 1:9; James 5: 16; Romans 10:9-10). Christians confess their sins to God to practice humility before him and to fess up to the bad things they have done. It takes a humble person to admit their mistakes! Humility is a vital part of confession and aids the restoration of Christians who have quenched the Spirit of God (1 Peter 5:6; James 4:6; 2 Corinthians 7:9-10; Psalm 32:1-5; Proverbs 28:13). OECT confesses; The Triune God - Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior and the Gospel as the power of God for the salvation of all who believe. OECT confesses; Jesus Christ is the Word of God incarnate, through whom everything was made and through whose life, death, and resurrection God fashions a new creation. OECT confesses; The canonical Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments as the inspired Word of God and the authoritative source and norm of its proclamation, faith, and life, according to which our doctrines should be judged."
